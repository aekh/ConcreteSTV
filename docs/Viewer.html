    <h2>Instructions for viewing election changes</h2>
    <p>This page allows you to examine specific vote changes that can change outcomes in elections.
    <p>Click on the browse button above to select the .vchange file. You will be shown one or more small vote changes
        or vote additions that alter the outcome in that contest, specifying:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Ballots:</b> how many votes are involved </li>
        <li><b>Effect:</b> which candidate(s) are added or removed from the list of elected candidates</li>
        <li><b>How:</b> What the change involves. <em>Changed</em> means some ballots were changed; <em>Added</em>
            means some votes were added. <em>Removed</em> means some ballots were removed.
            <em>ATL</em> means some above the line votes were affected (this can be
            prohibited in some scenarios). <em>First Preferences</em> means some first preference votes were
            affected (this can be prohibited in some scenarios). <em>Affected Verifiable</em> means some
            votes considered verifiable were affected (this is situation dependent).
            <em>Direct to beneficiary</em> means some manipulations directly went to some candidate
            (or their party in an ATL vote) who ended up winning as a result of the manipulation.
            <em>Direct from victim</em> means some manipulations directly came from some candidate
            (or their party in an ATL vote) who ended up losing as a result of the manipulation.
            <em>Generally, the fewer tags in this column the harder it is to detect.</em>
        </li>
        <li><b>Details:</b> a summary of the vote changes. Hover your mouse over them to see exactly which votes are changed or added</li>
