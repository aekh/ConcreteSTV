## Schedule 5 Counting of votes under proportional system

```text

1   General

    This Schedule sets out the method of counting votes according to the proportional system. The counting is to be carried out under the supervision of the returning officer.

2   Definitions

    In this Schedule—
    continuing candidate means at any given time a candidate not already elected or not already excluded from the poll.
    elected candidate means the following—

        (a)  a candidate who has obtained a quota of votes,

        (b)  a candidate who is elected under clause 11.

    exhausted ballot-paper means a ballot-paper on which there is no indication of a next preference for a continuing candidate.
    fraction includes a decimal fraction.
    next preference means the first of the subsequent preferences marked on a ballot-paper that is not given to an elected or excluded candidate. However, if there is a repetition or omission in the consecutive numbering of preferences marked on a ballot-paper (other than a repetition or omission that makes the ballot-paper informal), only those preferences preceding the repetition or omission can be taken into account.
    quota means the number of votes sufficient to elect a candidate.
    surplus, at any given time, means the number of votes which a candidate has obtained at that time in excess of the quota.

3   Count of first preferences

    The ballot-papers are to be examined and the number of first preferences obtained by each candidate and the aggregate number of first preferences are to be counted.

4   Quota

    The aggregate number of first preferences is divided by one more than the number of candidates to be elected. The quotient (disregarding any remainder), increased by one, becomes the quota.

5   Election on first preferences

        (1)  A candidate who has, upon the first preferences being counted, a number of first preferences equal to or greater than the quota is elected.

        (2)  If the number of first preferences obtained by the candidate is equal to the quota, all the ballot-papers on which first preferences are recorded for that candidate are set aside as finally dealt with.

6   Surplus on first count

        (1)  If the number of first preferences obtained by any elected candidate exceeds the quota, the surplus is to be transferred to the continuing candidates next in the order of voters’ preferences, in accordance with the following directions—

            (a)  the ballot-papers on which first preferences are recorded for the elected candidate are re-examined, and the number of second preferences, or (in accordance with clause 12 of this Schedule) third or next consecutive preferences, recorded on them for each continuing candidate and the number of exhausted ballot-papers is counted,

            (b)  the surplus is to be divided by the total number of first preferences recorded for such an elected candidate (excluding any exhausted ballot-papers). The transfer value is equal to the resulting fraction or (if the fraction exceeds 1) to 1,

            (c)  the number of second or other preferences, ascertained in paragraph (a) as being recorded for each continuing candidate, is multiplied by the transfer value,

            (d)  the resulting number (disregarding any fraction) for each continuing candidate is added to the number of votes obtained by the continuing candidate on the counting of first preferences and all those ballot-papers are to be transferred to the continuing candidate.

        (2)  However, this clause is subject to clause 11 of this Schedule, and if at any time there is one remaining vacancy which can be filled under that clause, no further transfer under this clause can be made.

7   Surplus on transfer

        (1)  If by a transfer of a surplus on the count of first preferences or of a surplus under this clause the number of votes obtained by a candidate equals or exceeds the quota, the candidate is elected.

        (2)  In that case, despite the fact that the candidate has reached the quota and is elected, the transfer is to be completed, and all the votes to which the candidate is entitled from the transfer are to be transferred to the candidate.

        (3)  If by a transfer the number of votes obtained by a candidate equals the quota, the whole of the ballot-papers on which those votes are recorded are set aside as finally dealt with, being the ballot-papers by which that candidate is elected.

        (4)  If by a transfer the number of votes obtained by a candidate exceeds the quota, the surplus is transferred to the continuing candidates next in the order of the voters’ respective preferences in the following manner—

            (a)  the number of surplus votes is to be divided by the number of votes received by the elected candidate (excluding the aggregate value of any exhausted votes). The surplus fraction is equal to the resulting fraction or (if the fraction exceeds 1) to 1,

            (b)  in relation to any particular ballot-papers for surplus votes of the elected candidate, the surplus fraction is to be multiplied by the transfer value at which those ballot-papers were transferred to the elected candidate, or by one if they expressed first preference votes for the elected candidate, and the product is to be the continued transfer value of those particular ballot papers,

            (c)  the total number of ballot-papers for surplus votes of the elected candidate that each—

                (i)  express the next available preference for a particular continuing candidate, and

                (ii)  have a particular continued transfer value,

            are to be multiplied by that continued transfer value and the number obtained (disregarding any fraction) is to be added to the number of votes of the continuing candidate and all those ballot papers are to be transferred to the continuing candidate.

        (5)  However, this clause is subject to clause 11 of this Schedule, and if at any time there is one remaining vacancy which can be filled under that clause, no further transfer under this clause can be made.

        (6)  For the purposes of excluding the aggregate value of any exhausted votes under subclause (4)(a), the exhausted votes are to be excluded at the value that the votes were transferred to the candidate.

8   Transfer of surpluses

        (1)  If, on the counting of the first preferences or on any transfer, more than one candidate has a surplus, the largest of the surpluses is transferred, then the next largest, and so on.

        (2)  However, if there is an untransferred surplus obtained at a previous count or transfer, that surplus is transferred before those caused by subsequent transfers.

        (3)  If there are equal surpluses at the first count, the returning officer decides by lot which surplus is transferred first.

        (4)  If there are equal surpluses at a later count or at a transfer, the surplus of the candidate who was the highest on the poll at the count or transfer at which the tied candidates last had an unequal number of votes is the first to be transferred. If those candidates have had an equal number of votes at all preceding counts or transfers, the returning officer decides by lot which candidate’s surplus is the first to be transferred.

9   Exclusion of lowest candidates

        (1)  If, after the first preferences have been counted and transfers of surpluses have been made, fewer than the number of candidates required to be elected have obtained the quota, the candidate lowest on the poll is excluded.

        (2)  The votes of the excluded candidate are to be transferred to the continuing candidates as follows—

            (a)  the total number of ballot-papers of the excluded candidate on which first preferences are recorded and which express a next available preference for a particular continuing candidate are to be transferred (each ballot-paper at a transfer value of one) to that continuing candidate and added to the number of votes of the continuing candidate,

            (b)  the total number (if any) of other votes obtained by the excluded candidate on transfers under this Schedule are to be transferred from the excluded candidate in the order of the transfers on which the excluded candidate obtained them (the votes obtained on the earliest transfer being transferred first) as follows—

                (i)  the total number of ballot-papers transferred to the excluded candidate from a particular candidate and expressing a next available preference for a particular continuing candidate are to be multiplied by the transfer value at which the votes were transferred to the excluded candidate,

                (ii)  the number so obtained (disregarding any fraction) is to be added to the number of votes of the continuing candidate,

                (iii)  all those ballot papers are to be transferred to the continuing candidate.

        (3)  Any exhausted ballot-papers are set aside as finally dealt with.

        (4)  The same process of exclusion and transfer is repeated until all the candidates, except the number required to be elected, have been excluded. At that point, the continuing candidates who have not already been elected are elected.

        (5)  Whenever it becomes necessary to exclude a candidate and two or more candidates have the same number of votes and are lowest on the poll, the one who was lowest on the poll at the last count or transfer at which they had an unequal number of votes is first excluded.

        (6)  If those candidates have had equal numbers of votes at all preceding counts or transfers, or there has been no preceding count, the returning officer decides by lot which candidate is first excluded.

        (7)  This clause is subject to clause 11 of this Schedule, and if at any time there is one remaining vacancy which can be filled under that clause, no further exclusion under this clause can be made.

10   Effect of reaching quota while transfers are proceeding

        (1)  If by a transfer under clause 9 of this Schedule, the number of votes obtained by a candidate equals or exceeds the quota, the candidate is elected.

        (2)  In that case, despite the fact that the candidate has reached the quota, the transfer is to be completed, and all the votes to which the candidate is entitled from the transfer are to be transferred to the candidate.

        (3)  If by a transfer under clause 9 of this Schedule, the number of votes obtained by a candidate equals the quota, the whole of the ballot-papers on which those votes are recorded are set aside as finally dealt with, being the ballot-papers by which the candidate is elected.

        (4)  If by a transfer under clause 9 of this Schedule, the number of votes obtained by a candidate exceeds the quota, the surplus is transferred to the continuing candidates next in the order of the voters’ respective preferences in the manner set out in clause 7(4) of this Schedule.

11   Election without reaching quota

        (1)  When the number of continuing candidates is reduced to the number of vacancies remaining unfilled the continuing candidates are elected, even if they have not reached the quota.

        (2)  When only one vacancy remains unfilled and the votes of one continuing candidate exceed the total of all the votes of the other continuing candidates, together with any surplus not transferred, that candidate is elected.

        (3)  When more than one vacancy remains unfilled and the votes of the candidate who (if all the vacancies were filled by the successive election of the continuing candidates with the largest number of votes) would be the last to be elected exceed the total of any surplus not transferred plus the votes of all the continuing candidates with fewer votes than that candidate, that candidate and all the other continuing candidates who do not have fewer votes than that candidate are elected.

        (4)  When only one vacancy remains unfilled, and there are only 2 continuing candidates, and those 2 candidates each have the same number of votes, and no surplus votes remain capable of transfer, one candidate is excluded in accordance with clause 9(5) and (6) of this Schedule and the other is elected.

12   Determining order of preference

    In determining which candidate is next in the order of the voter’s preference, any candidates who have been declared elected or who have been excluded are not considered, and the order of the voter’s preference is determined as if the names of those candidates had not been on the ballot-paper.

13   Deciding by random selection

    A matter that is required to be decided by the returning officer by lot under this Schedule is to be decided by an approved method of random selection (including by electronic means).

14   Check counting

        (1)  A scrutineer may at any time during the counting of the votes, either before the commencement or after the completion of the transfer of the votes (whether original or transferred votes) of any candidate, request the returning officer to make a check count of the papers then comprised in the parcels of all or any candidates (but not of papers set aside as finally dealt with).

        (2)  The returning officer is to make a check count immediately on receiving the request, unless the returning officer has already made a check count of the same votes.

        (3)  The returning officer may also recount votes as often as he or she thinks necessary to establish accuracy.

15   Records and publication of results

        (1)  At each step of the proceedings the returning officer is to keep a record of the following—

            (a)  the number of votes counted for each candidate,

            (b)  the transfer of surpluses,

            (c)  votes lost through the disregarding of any fractions of votes during the process of transfer,

            (d)  the exclusion of candidates and the transfer of their votes,

            (e)  the votes which are found to be informal,

            (f)  the votes which at some stage become exhausted votes.

        (2)  As soon as is reasonably practical after the declaration of the election, the election manager is to publish the results of the election (including a record of the voting, counting and transfers) on the election manager’s website.

16   Electronic counting of votes

    If votes are counted using electronic counting equipment, the returning officer may determine that a reference in this Schedule to the physical arrangement or movement of ballot papers is not applicable if the equivalent process is performed electronically.

## Schedule 4 Counting of votes under optional preferential system

```text
1   General

    This Schedule sets out the method of counting votes according to the optional preferential system. The counting is to be carried out under the supervision of the returning officer.

2   Definitions

    In this Schedule—
    absolute majority of votes means a greater number than one-half of the whole number of ballot-papers other than informal and exhausted ballot-papers.
    continuing candidate means a candidate not already elected or excluded from the count.
    exhausted ballot-paper means a ballot-paper on which there is no indication of a next preference for a continuing candidate.
    next preference means the first of the subsequent preferences marked on a ballot-paper that is not given to an elected or excluded candidate. However, if there is a repetition or omission in the consecutive numbering of preferences marked on a ballot-paper (other than a repetition or omission that makes the ballot-paper informal), only those preferences preceding the repetition or omission can be taken into account.
    unrejected ballot-papers means all ballot-papers not rejected as informal.

3   Counting of votes

        (1)  The votes are to be counted and the result of the election ascertained in accordance with the following procedures—

            (a)  the unrejected ballot-papers are arranged under the names of the respective candidates by placing in a separate parcel all those on which a first preference is indicated for the same candidate,

            (b)  the total number of first preferences given for each candidate on such ballot-papers are then counted,

            (c)  the candidate who has received the largest number of first preference votes is elected if that number constitutes an absolute majority of votes,

            (d)  if no candidate has received an absolute majority of first preference votes, a second count is made,

            (e)  on the second count the candidate who has received the fewest first preference votes is excluded, and each unexhausted ballot-paper counted to him or her is counted to the candidate next in the order of the voter’s preference,

            (f)  if a candidate then has an absolute majority of votes, he or she is elected, but if no candidate then has an absolute majority of votes, the process of excluding the candidate who has the fewest votes and counting each of his or her unexhausted ballot-papers to the continuing candidate next in the order of the voter’s preference is repeated until one candidate has received an absolute majority of votes,

            (g)  the candidate who has received an absolute majority of votes is elected.

        (2)  Any exhausted ballot-papers are set aside as finally dealt with and are not taken into account in the election of a candidate.

4, 5   (Repealed)
6   Equality

        (1)  If, on any count at which the candidate with the fewest number of votes has to be excluded, 2 or more candidates have an equal number of votes (that number being fewer than the number of votes that any other candidate has or those candidates being the only continuing candidates)—

            (a)  the candidate who had the fewest votes at the last count before the equality occurred is excluded, or

            (b)  if they had an equal number of votes at all preceding counts, the returning officer is to exclude a candidate by an approved method of random selection (including by electronic means).

        (2)    (Repealed)

7   End of counting

    The process of counting each of the unexhausted ballot-papers of an excluded candidate to the continuing candidate next in the order of the voter’s preference is not repeated if there is only one continuing candidate. Instead, that continuing candidate is elected.

8   Records and returns of voting

        (1)  At each step of the proceedings the returning officer is to keep a record of the number of votes counted for each candidate, the exclusion of candidates and the transfer of their votes, the votes that are found to be informal and the votes that at some stage become exhausted votes.

        (2)  As soon as is reasonably practical after the declaration of the election, the election manager is to publish the results of the election (including a record of the voting, counting and transfers) on the election manager’s website.

9   Electronic counting of votes

    If votes are counted using electronic counting equipment, the returning officer may determine that a reference in this Schedule to the physical arrangement or movement of ballot-papers is not applicable if the equivalent process is performed electronically.
