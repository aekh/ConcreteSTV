    <h1>N-Party Preferred Count</h1>
    <div class="noprint">
        <p>This table allows you to conduct a more general version of the
            traditional two-party-preferred count, including extra details about
            how other candidates’ preferences flowed to the preferred parties.
        </p>
        <p>
            Choose at least two "major parties" or candidates. Each formal ballot
            paper is then assigned to one of the "major parties" based on which of
            them is highest on the ballot - this simulates what happens when all
            but the “major parties” are eliminated. If none of them are mentioned,
            the ballot is considered exhausted. This determines the column in which
            the ballot is counted. Ballots are allocated to rows according to their
            first preference.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, to get the standard two-party-preferred count between two
            parties, select them both under “who is a major party.” Then each row
            of the table will represent a candidate or party, and show how their
            preferences affected the two-party-preferred count.

            If you selected “major parties” A and B, and the row for candidate c
            shows 100 under party A, 200 under party B and 50 exhausted, this means
            that candidate c received 350 first preferences, of which 100 preferred
            A over B, 200 preferred B over A, and 50 mentioned neither A nor B.
