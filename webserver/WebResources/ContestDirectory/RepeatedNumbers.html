    <div class="noprint">
        <p>This table shows the total number of repeated preference numbers or missing preference numbers in below the line
            votes published by the electoral commission, as a function of the preference number.</p>
        <h4>Precise definitions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The <em>Ok up to</em> column contains the number of papers that contain a BTL vote of a given length (which may or may not be formal).
                For the row with preference <em>n</em>, this means that each number from <em>1..n</em> inclusive appears exactly once,
                and <em>n+1</em> does not appear exactly once.
            </li>
            <li>The <em>Repeated Papers</em> column contains the number of papers that contain a BTL preference of a given value present
            more than one time.</li>
            <li>The <em>Repeated</em> column contains the number of times that a BTL preference of a given value is repeated. If, for example,
                in a given paper there are three occurrences of the preference <em>42</em>, that counts as two repeats. This number can never
                be lower than the prior column, <em>Repeated Papers</em>.</li>
            <li>The <em>Missing</em> column contains the number of times that a BTL preference of a given value seems to be missing.
                For the row with preference <em>n</em>, this means that <em>n-1</em> and <em>n+1</em> are both present exactly
                once, and <em>n</em> is not present. As special cases, for the first preferences, a prior preference is not required, and a subsequent preference
                is not required for the last preference.</li>
