    <h2 id="heading">Privacy</h2>
    <p>I value your privacy very highly, and work hard to maximise it. The website is designed to minimise the information about you that it receives. The source code is  <a href="https://github.com/AndrewConway/ConcreteSTV">open</a>.</p>
    <h3>How data is minimized</h3>
    <p>This website does not use cookies, does not use externally hosted content, and does not have any concept of users or logging in. It does not ask for names or any gratuitous personal information.</p>
    <p>Where reasonably practical, web pages are designed to load all their data at the start and do not initiate further communication with the server about what you are doing on that page.
        The exceptions are ones which require extra data due to changing what you are looking at or doing a search.</p>
    <h3>What data is sent to the server</h3>
    <p>The normal data necessary to provide physical transport of web pages is, perforce, sent over the internet and to my server. This includes IP address, the page/data
        you are fetching, and whatever browser information your browser sends by default. Some of this is logged by the web server, for maintenance and diagnostics reasons.
        These logs are not preserved indefinitely. There is no intention of providing said logs to anyone else (but see <em>big sticks</em> below). Your telecommunications
        provider(s) and equipment manufacturers may log communications.</p>
    <p>Generally, the particulars of what you are looking at are not very sensitive, with the exception of the prepare/search vote tool. This tool has a special
        description of its privacy issues on its page.</p>
    <p>All of these fine intentions are of course subject to me being coerced, either legally, by hackers, or by people with <em>big sticks</em>.</p>
    <h3>How do I contact you for queries / requests / complaints / threats with a big stick?</h3>
    <p>Email queries / requests / complaints / big sticks / to the address in the <a href="/Contact.html">Contact</a> page.</p>
